Livestream Vulkan
------

A (very) simple example to test the brand new Khronos library Vulkan (also known as OpenGL next).
The full process to make the application was recorded live on LiveCoding.com, you can watch the full record on this playlist : https://www.livecoding.tv/playlists/?q=massile

Why ?
---

Just by curiousity !

 - I've learned how to use the 3D software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to understand how 3D models are created...
 - then I've learned Python scripting with [then Blender API](https://www.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_2_78a_release/) to have a general idea on how such a software is organised...
 - when ready, I moved on C++ and OpenGL to have a better understanding on how to create 3D engines...
 - and now, I'm trying to learn Vulkan to learn how the GPU and the OpenGL pipeline works.

Newt time will probably be something like [Nvidia CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html).
